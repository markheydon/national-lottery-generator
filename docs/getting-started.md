## Understanding the Results

### Main Suggested Lines

These are the primary number suggestions based on the app's analysis of historical draws. The algorithm looks at patterns and frequencies to create these lines.

### Other Suggestions

These are alternative lines generated using slightly different approaches. They give you more options to choose from.

### Latest Draw Date

The app shows you when the most recent draw data was collected. This helps you know the data is current.

## Tips for Using the App

💡 **Generate fresh numbers regularly** – The app updates with new draw data automatically, so you can come back anytime for fresh suggestions.

💡 **Mix and match** – Feel free to combine numbers from different lines if you prefer.

💡 **Compare games** – Try generating numbers for different games to see which ones appeal to you.

💡 **Don't take it too seriously** – Remember, this is just for fun! The lottery is random, and no algorithm can predict the results.

## Important Reminders

⚠️ **This is entertainment, not a prediction tool.** The National Lottery draws are completely random. Past results don't influence future outcomes.

⚠️ **The numbers generated are no more likely to win than random numbers.** They're created using a playful algorithm, not a scientific prediction method.

⚠️ **Always gamble responsibly.** Only spend what you can afford to lose, and remember that lottery games are meant to be fun.
