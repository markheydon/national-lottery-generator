### Is this app affiliated with the National Lottery?

## About the Numbers

### Will these numbers help me win?

**No.** The lottery is completely random, and no algorithm or analysis can predict future results. The numbers generated by this app are no more likely to win than any random selection.

Past lottery results have absolutely no influence on future draws. Each draw is independent.

### How are the numbers generated?

The app downloads historical draw data from the National Lottery and analyses patterns like number frequencies and combinations. It then uses this information (along with some randomness) to create suggestions.

For a detailed explanation, see [How It Works](how-it-works.md).

### Why do I get different numbers each time?

The algorithm includes an element of randomness to keep things interesting. While it considers historical patterns, it doesn't always suggest the exact same numbers.

### Are the numbers really random?

Not entirely. They're based on analysis of past draws with some randomness mixed in. If you want truly random numbers, most lottery websites offer "Lucky Dip" or "Quick Pick" options.

### Can I use these numbers to play the lottery?

Yes, you can use any numbers the app generates when purchasing lottery tickets. Just remember that they're no more likely to win than any other numbers!

## Technical Questions

### How often does the data update?

The app checks for new draw data automatically. If the cached information is older than 24 hours, it downloads the latest results from the National Lottery website.

You don't need to do anything – it updates itself.

### What if the latest draw isn't showing?

The app relies on the National Lottery publishing their draw data online. There may be a short delay between a draw taking place and the data becoming available.

If you notice the data is more than a few days old, please report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/markheydon/national-lottery-generator/issues).

### Does the app work on mobile devices?

Yes! The website is responsive and works on smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.

### Can I use the app offline?

No, the app needs an internet connection to download the latest draw data and generate numbers.

### Is my data safe?

The app doesn't collect, store, or track any personal information about users. It simply generates numbers and displays them in your browser.
